# Vivid-2016---Musicality
Vivid Musicality Concept

Elements of music and rhythm pulsate out from a projected silhouette of the person. Pulses change in desing based off an element
in music which a person is able to control with their dance/movements. The idea is to represent how people interpret music.

**Master: Basic concept visual of musicality**
- Current
    - 360 audio channels to correlate with the 360 degrees/points
    - Objects react to the audio channel values (if the audio channel is above 0.6, run the animation)
    - Different audio channels maybe representing different volumes levels
- Expected
    - Separate the different sounds and instruments of the audio file and the different objects react to when the sound plays
    - Instead of a circle, the points revolve around a silhouette figure
    - In addition, the objects are able to react to a person's movement in correlation to the sound/instrument being played.
    - Kinect integration
- Future:
    - More designs
    - Background designs

**3D-Musicality**
- Current
    - 3D representation of the master repository
    - removed the radians function from *delta* to have a more random pattern
    - increased the speed to rotation
    - rotating the objects on the Y axis to simulate a 3D sphere
    - rotated the whole sketch on the Y axis
